Unauthorized or accidental purchases on shared family devices due to missing purchase protection mechanisms.

## Related Exploratory Findings

- EF-03: Frictionless purchase flow amplifying unauthorized access risk

## Risk Severity
**Critical**

## Justification

- High likelihood due to common shared-device usage
- No user-side mitigation available
- Potential customer trust and brand reputation impact

## Affected Scenarios
