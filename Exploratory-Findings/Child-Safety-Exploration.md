# Exploratory Findings – Child Safety in E-Commerce

## EF-01 – One-Tap Purchase Risk on Shared Devices

During exploratory testing from a child perspective, it was observed that a purchase can be completed with a single tap when address and payment information are saved.

No additional verification (password, PIN, or biometric confirmation) is required before completing the transaction.

### Risk Observation
This behavior increases the risk of unauthorized or accidental purchases by children using shared family devices.

### Test Approach
- Exploratory manual testing
- Child-user mindset
- Shared device scenario
Add EF-01 exploratory finding for child safety
